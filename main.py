"""
This program converts math equation in humanized style
(2+2=4 will be "two plus two equals four").

About input data info:
    possible symbols are +-*/= and digits;
    white symbols will be ignored (even inside number);
    the program checks whether input formulation is valid in sense of maths,
but this doesn't include arithmetical correctness
(2 + 2 = 5/0 it's ok, but  *3 ++ 02 = 2*/1 â€” invalid);
    one number can contain no more then 306 digits.

Example of your correct input -1+2/4*100    - 191432423 =-0/0.
Write equation to be converted in input.txt and see result in output.txt
by running main.py.

You can run pytests of this prog by command "pytest testsCalculator.py" in your terminal.
